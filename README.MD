# What is this project?
This is a user account creation and login page where users can create an account and login. Users are authorised and 
then logged in, with their username being displayed as logged in if successful.

## What technologies did I use?
The Front-end was created with EJS as the template engine and standard CSS to style the pages. The Back-end was created
using NodeJS and ExpressJS and users are stored in a database file using SQlite3. For user authentication I used a package called PassportJS and in order to hash passwords
for security, i used another package called BcryptJS.
